# Session Summary: October 25, 2025 - Gemini

## Overview
This session focused on resolving a critical memory allocation error in the `ingest.py` script that prevented the vector database from being populated. The root cause was the script loading all PDF documents into memory at once.

## Problem Analysis
The `ingest.py` script failed consistently during execution. The primary reasons identified were:
1.  **Bulk Loading:** `SimpleDirectoryReader` was loading the entire corpus of PDF documents into RAM simultaneously.
2.  **Memory Pressure:** The combined memory usage of the Python process, the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model, and the full document set exceeded the available system RAM, causing the OS to terminate the script.

## Changes Implemented (Last 5 Hours)

To resolve this, the ingestion script was significantly refactored.

**1. Modified `backend/ingest.py`:**
*   The script was changed from a bulk-processing to a file-by-file processing model.
*   The `main` function now gets a list of all PDF file paths and iterates through them one by one.
*   Inside the loop, `SimpleDirectoryReader` is called for each individual file.
*   A new `ingest_document` function processes the chunks from a single document, ensuring a minimal memory footprint at all times.

**2. Created `10252025_4-49PM_progress.md`:**
*   This document was created to provide a detailed comparison between the project's current status and the original `SIX_WEEK_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.

**3. Created `WEEKS_3-4_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`:**
*   This new plan provides a detailed, incremental task list for the next two weeks of development, focusing on implementing WebSocket streaming (Week 3) and a comprehensive evaluation framework (Week 4).

## Current Status
*   The refactored ingestion script was started with the `--overwrite` flag to rebuild the ChromaDB collection from scratch.
*   The command is running in the background, with its output being logged to `fixed_ingestion.log`.
*   The session limit was reached while this process was executing.

## Next Steps (for a Fresh Runpod Instance)

1.  **Provision a New Runpod Instance:**
    *   Use a template with sufficient resources (e.g., RTX A5000 or similar).
    *   Ensure system dependencies like Python 3.10+, Node.js, and Git are available.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mrizvi96/AIMentorProject.git
    cd AIMentorProject
    ```

3.  **Set Up Python Environment:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Upload LLM Model:**
    *   Follow the procedure in `USB_WORKFLOW.md` or your established method to upload the `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.gguf` model file into the `/workspace/models/` directory on the Runpod instance.

5.  **Start the LLM Server:**
    *   Run the server in a detached `tmux` session to keep it active.
    ```bash
    tmux new-session -d -s llm './start_llm_server.sh'
    ```
    *   Verify it's running after a minute or two: `curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models | jq`

6.  **Run the Ingestion Script:**
    *   This will use the newly fixed script to populate the ChromaDB vector store. This is a critical step.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    source venv/bin/activate
    python3 ingest.py --directory ../course_materials/ --overwrite
    cd ..
    ```
    *   Monitor the output of this script to ensure it completes without memory errors.

7.  **Start the Backend API Server:**
    *   Run the FastAPI server in another `tmux` session.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    tmux new-session -d -s api 'source venv/bin/activate && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload'
    cd ..
    ```
    *   Verify it's running: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/health | jq`

8.  **Begin Week 3 Development:**
    *   Once the environment is fully set up and data is ingested, you can proceed with the tasks outlined in `WEEKS_3-4_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.
