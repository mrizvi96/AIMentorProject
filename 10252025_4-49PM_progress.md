# Project Progress vs. SIX_WEEK_EXECUTION_PLAN.md

## High-Level Summary

The project is currently at the transition point between **Week 2 (Agentic RAG)** and **Week 3 (Streaming)**. The core goals of the first two weeks have been met, but with a significant deviation in the technology stack and a recent course correction in implementation strategy.

## Week-by-Week Comparison

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

*   **Plan:**
    *   Set up infrastructure with **Milvus** via Docker Compose.
    *   Implement a simple RAG pipeline (retrieve -> generate).
    *   Build a basic FastAPI backend and Svelte frontend.
*   **Progress & Deviations:**
    *   **Completed, with a major deviation.** The plan to use Milvus failed due to Runpod's environmental limitations (no Docker Compose).
    *   **Deviation:** The project successfully pivoted to **ChromaDB** in a file-based mode, which bypassed the server startup issues encountered with Milvus Lite.
    *   The simple RAG MVP and the frontend/backend structure were completed as planned, but adapted for ChromaDB.

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Weeks 2-3)

*   **Plan (Week 2):**
    *   Implement the agentic RAG workflow using **LangGraph**.
    *   Focus on the self-correcting logic: retrieve → grade → rewrite → generate.
*   **Plan (Week 3):**
    *   Implement **WebSocket streaming** for real-time responses.
*   **Progress & Deviations:**
    *   **Week 2 Goal Achieved (after a misstep).** The agentic workflow with LangGraph was implemented.
    *   **Misstep:** The implementation deviated from the plan by attempting to build the **streaming logic (a Week 3 task) inside the agentic nodes (a Week 2 task)**. This was a premature optimization that caused the streaming to fail because the LangGraph event system was bypassed.
    *   **Correction:** The issue was resolved by reverting the agentic nodes to be **non-streaming** (using `llm.complete()` instead of `llm.stream_chat()`).
    *   **Current Status:** The project now has a functional, **non-streaming agentic RAG workflow**, which correctly aligns with the end-goal of Week 2. The project is now properly prepared to begin the Week 3 task of adding the streaming layer on top of the working agentic system.

### Overall Assessment

Despite the initial infrastructure challenges and the recent implementation bug, the project is **roughly on schedule**.

*   **What's Done:**
    *   A complete, simple RAG pipeline.
    *   A working, non-streaming agentic RAG with self-correction.
    *   A functional UI and API.
*   **What's Next (per the plan):**
    *   **Week 3:** Implement the streaming layer correctly at the graph level.
    *   **Week 4:** Begin comprehensive evaluation and prompt engineering.

The key takeaway from the progress so far is the validation of the plan's phased approach. The attempt to merge Week 2 and Week 3 tasks proved that building the non-streaming logic first is a critical step for stability and easier debugging.
