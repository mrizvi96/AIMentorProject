# Project Audit and Next Steps - 10/30/2025

## 1. Project Status Evaluation

This document provides a critical evaluation of the AI Mentor project's status by comparing the original plans with the current implementation.

### 1.1. Comparison with `plan.txt` (Initial Plan)

The initial project setup aligns well with the original `plan.txt`.

*   **Project Scaffolding:** The monorepo structure with `backend` and `frontend` directories is correctly implemented.
*   **Backend:** The FastAPI backend structure is in place, including the `app` directory with `api`, `core`, and `services`. `ingest.py` for data ingestion has been created.
*   **Frontend:** The Svelte frontend is set up with the expected structure, including `package.json` and `svelte.config.js`.
*   **Database and Inference:** `docker-compose.yml` for managing services like Milvus is present. The `start_llm_server.sh` script corresponds to the planned `start_llm.sh`.

**Conclusion:** The project successfully implemented the foundational structure outlined in `plan.txt`.

### 1.2. Comparison with `WEEKS_1-2_SUMMARY.md`

The project has successfully adapted its deployment strategy as detailed in this summary.

*   **USB Workflow:** The project pivoted from a Docker Hub-based deployment to a more efficient USB drive workflow. The existence of `USB_WORKFLOW.md`, `start_llm_server.sh`, and an updated `RUNPOD_QUICK_START.md` confirms this.

**Conclusion:** The project has demonstrated adaptability and improved its development workflow.

### 1.3. Comparison with `WEEKS_3-4_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`

There are significant deviations from this plan, particularly in the frontend and evaluation tasks.

*   **Backend (Streaming):** The backend implementation for WebSocket streaming is partially complete. `backend/app/api/chat_ws.py` and `test_streaming_ws.py` have been created.
*   **Frontend (Streaming):** The frontend part of the streaming feature is lagging. The plan specified a `websocket.ts` service, which has not been created. The main chat UI (`+page.svelte`) has not been updated to handle WebSocket communication.
*   **Evaluation Framework:** The entire evaluation framework planned for Week 4 is missing. The `backend/evaluation` directory, along with the question bank, metrics definition, and evaluation script, has not been created.

**Conclusion:** The project is behind schedule on the tasks outlined for Weeks 3-4. The backend work for streaming is underway, but the frontend and evaluation components are missing.

## 2. Overall Assessment

The project has a solid foundation and has shown the ability to adapt its approach (the USB workflow). However, development has slowed, and the project is not on track with the `WEEKS_3-4_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`. The lack of an evaluation framework is a critical gap, as it's essential for measuring and improving the RAG system's performance.

## 3. Proposed Next Steps

The immediate priority is to complete the work planned for Weeks 3-4.

### 3.1. Complete WebSocket Streaming Feature (Frontend)

1.  **Create `frontend/src/lib/websocket.ts`:** Implement the WebSocket service to manage the connection to the backend.
2.  **Update `+page.svelte`:** Refactor the chat page to use the new WebSocket service for real-time communication.
3.  **Implement UI Updates:** Display the agent's workflow state changes and stream the final answer token by token.

### 3.2. Build the Evaluation Framework

1.  **Create `backend/evaluation` directory.**
2.  **Create `backend/evaluation/question_bank.json`:** Populate it with a diverse set of questions.
3.  **Create `backend/evaluation/METRICS.md`:** Define the evaluation criteria (Answer Relevance, Faithfulness, Conciseness).
4.  **Create `backend/evaluation/run_evaluation.py`:** Implement the script to run the evaluation and save the results.

### 3.3. Conduct Evaluation and Refine Prompts

1.  **Run the evaluation:** Execute the `run_evaluation.py` script to get baseline performance data.
2.  **Analyze results:** Score the responses and identify weaknesses.
3.  **Refine prompts:** Iteratively improve the prompts in `agentic_rag.py` based on the analysis.
4.  **Re-evaluate:** Run the evaluation again to measure the impact of the prompt changes.

By focusing on these steps, the project can get back on track and ensure the AI Mentor is both functional and effective.
