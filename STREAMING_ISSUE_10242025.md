# Streaming Issue with LangGraph (10/24/2025)

## Problem
The streaming test for the agentic RAG workflow is failing. The test runs without errors, but the final answer is empty.

## Analysis
The root cause of the issue is that the `on_chat_model_stream` event is not being triggered when using the `astream_events` method from LangGraph. This is happening even though the `stream_chat` method is being used in the `_generate` and `_grade_documents` nodes.

I have tried the following approaches to fix this issue:
1.  **Using `astream_events` with `version="v2"`:** This was the recommended approach, but it did not trigger the `on_chat_model_stream` event.
2.  **Using `astream_events` with `version="v1"` and checking the `workflow_path`:** This approach also failed because the `state` object, which contains the `workflow_path`, is not available in the `on_chat_model_stream` event.

## Next Steps
The next step is to debug the `astream_events` method in more detail to understand why the `on_chat_model_stream` event is not being triggered.

Here are some things to try:
*   **Inspect the `llama-cpp-python` server logs:** Check the logs to see if the streaming request is being received correctly and if the server is sending back a streaming response.
*   **Use a simpler LangGraph setup:** Create a minimal LangGraph with a single node that calls the `stream_chat` method to isolate the issue.
*   **Consult the LangGraph documentation and community:** Look for examples of how to use `astream_events` with a custom LLM that supports streaming.
