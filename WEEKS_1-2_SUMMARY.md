# Weeks 1-2 Implementation Summary

## What Changed

The storage plan has been updated from Docker Hub to a **USB Drive workflow** for better portability and simplicity. Here's what's new:

### Problem Solved
**Before:** Every Runpod startup required:
- 60+ minutes to download 4.8GB Mistral model from HuggingFace
- Manual installation of dependencies
- Configuring Python environments
- Starting services manually

**After:** Every Runpod startup takes:
- **10-15 minutes** with USB drive upload
- One command: `./start_llm_server.sh`
- Portable model storage on USB drive
- Works across any Runpod instance

---

## New Files Created

### 1. `USB_WORKFLOW.md` (Primary Reference)
**Purpose:** Complete guide for USB drive-based Runpod setup

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites (USB drive, model file, VS Code)
- Quick start workflow (upload model, clone repo, start server)
- Testing instructions
- Service startup procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- Comparison with old workflow

**When to use:** Before starting Week 1 tasks

### 2. `start_llm_server.sh` (Automation Script)
**Purpose:** Single command to start LLM server

**What it does:**
1. Verifies model file exists in `/workspace/models/`
2. Installs llama-cpp-python with CUDA support
3. Starts Mistral-7B server on port 8080
4. Displays server status and access URLs

**Usage:**
```bash
./start_llm_server.sh
```

### 3. `RUNPOD_QUICK_START.md` (Updated)
**Purpose:** Complete streamlined setup guide with USB workflow

**Changes from previous version:**
- Removed Docker Hub image building steps
- Added USB drive upload instructions
- Simplified workflow to 5 easy steps
- Added VS Code Remote-SSH guidance
- Included SCP alternative for uploads

---

## Updated Files

### 1. `SIX_WEEK_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
**Changes:**
- Updated "Quick Start" section to reference USB workflow
- Changed Task 1.3 from "Download Model" to "Upload Model from USB Drive"
- Reduced setup time estimates (10-15 min vs 60+ min)
- References USB_WORKFLOW.md for detailed instructions

**Impact on timeline:**
- Week 1 Day 1-2: Was 10-12 hours → Now 4-6 hours (setup time reduced)
- More time for actual development tasks

### 2. `CLAUDE.md`
**No changes needed** - Already references RUNPOD_QUICK_START.md which has been updated

## USB Drive Setup

### One-Time Preparation (Already Complete)

You already have:
- ✅ USB drive with 100GB+ capacity
- ✅ Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.gguf (5.13 GB) stored on USB drive
- ✅ Model file verified and working

### Files on USB Drive

```
D:\ (USB Drive)
└── Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.gguf (5.13 GB)
```

**Keep this USB drive safe** - it's your portable AI model storage!

---

## Execution Flow

### Every-Time Startup (Repeat Always)

**Step 1:** Start Runpod instance
- Select RTX A5000 (24GB VRAM) or similar
- Base image: `runpod/pytorch:1.0.2-cu1281-torch280-ubuntu2404`
- Note SSH connection details

**Step 2:** Connect via VS Code Remote-SSH
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host"
- Enter: `root@[RUNPOD_IP]`
- Wait for connection

**Step 3:** Upload model from USB
```bash
# On Runpod, create directory
mkdir -p /workspace/models

# On Windows: Copy from USB (D:) to C:\temp\
# Then in VS Code: Upload C:\temp\*.gguf to /workspace/models/

# Time: 5-10 minutes
```

**Step 4:** Clone repository
```bash
cd /workspace
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AIMentorProject.git
cd AIMentorProject
chmod +x start_llm_server.sh
```

**Step 5:** Start LLM server
```bash
./start_llm_server.sh
```

The script will:
- Verify model file exists
- Install llama-cpp-python with CUDA support (~2-3 minutes)
- Start Mistral-7B server on port 8080

**Total startup time: ~10-15 minutes** (mostly model upload)

---

## Week 1-2 Task Alignment

### Original Plan
**Day 1-2 (10-12 hours):**
- Task 1.1: Project scaffolding (30 min)
- Task 1.2: Runpod setup (1-2 hours)
- Task 1.3: Download model (60+ min) ← **REPLACED**
- Task 1.4: Backend Python env (30 min)
- Task 1.5: Milvus setup (1 hour)
- Task 1.6: LLM server (30 min)
- Task 1.7: Backend structure (30 min)

### New Plan with USB Workflow
**Day 1-2 (4-6 hours):**
- **Upload model from USB:** 5-10 minutes ← **NEW**
- Task 1.1: Project scaffolding (30 min)
- Task 1.3: Start LLM server with script (2-3 min)
- Task 1.4: Backend Python env (30 min)
- Task 1.5: Milvus setup (1 hour)
- Task 1.7: Backend structure (30 min)

**Time reclaimed:** ~55 minutes per session
**Use for:** Testing, debugging, code quality, documentation

---

## Benefits Summary

### Speed
- **85% reduction** in model setup time
- From 60 min → 10 min per session (50 minutes saved!)

### Portability
- USB drive works with any Runpod instance
- No datacenter dependency
- Model always available offline

### Reliability
- No dependency on HuggingFace availability
- Consistent upload speed
- Simple, proven workflow

### Developer Experience
- Less waiting time = more development time
- Easy to iterate (stop/start pods frequently)
- Portable solution that works anywhere

### Cost
- Faster startup = less billable time on Runpod
- Can confidently stop pods between sessions
- Runpod charges by the minute

---

## Comparison: Old vs New Workflow

### Old Workflow (HuggingFace Download)
1. Start Runpod instance
2. Download model from HuggingFace: **60+ minutes** ⏳
3. Install llama-cpp-python: 2-3 minutes
4. Start server: 10 seconds
- **Total: ~65 minutes**

### New Workflow (USB Upload)
1. Start Runpod instance
2. Upload model from USB: **5-10 minutes** ✅
3. Clone repository: 30 seconds
4. Run `./start_llm_server.sh`: 2-3 minutes
5. Server starts: 10 seconds
- **Total: ~10-15 minutes**

**Time saved: 50+ minutes per instance!**

---

## Data Persistence

### Challenge
Runpod instances are ephemeral. Volumes are lost when pod stops (unless you have network storage).

### Solutions

#### Option A: Backup Milvus Data
```bash
# Before stopping pod
cd /workspace/AIMentorProject
tar -czf milvus-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz volumes/
# Download to local machine via VS Code

# On new pod
# Upload backup via VS Code and extract
tar -xzf milvus-backup-20241016.tar.gz
```

#### Option B: Re-ingest Documents (Development)
```bash
# Keep course_materials in Git or on USB drive
# Re-run ingestion on new pod (5-10 min for small datasets)
python ingest.py --directory ../course_materials
```

#### Option C: Network Storage (if available)
```bash
# Link to persistent volume
ln -s /runpod-volume/ai-mentor/volumes ./volumes
```

## Next Steps

### Before Week 1
1. ✅ Model stored on USB drive (complete)
2. ✅ USB_WORKFLOW.md created
3. ✅ start_llm_server.sh created
4. ✅ Documentation updated

### Week 1 Day 1
1. Start Runpod instance
2. Upload model from USB (10 min)
3. Run startup script
4. Begin Task 1.1 (project scaffolding)
5. Continue with Week 1 tasks

### Week 2+
1. Continue using USB upload workflow
2. Backup Milvus volumes regularly (if needed)
3. Iterate on development
4. Test with sample documents

---

## Troubleshooting

### Model upload is slow
**Solution:** Use SCP with compression
```powershell
scp -C "C:\temp\Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.gguf" root@[RUNPOD_IP]:/workspace/models/
```

### llama-cpp-python won't install
**Solution:** Reinstall with explicit CUDA support
```bash
CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_CUDA=on" pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall "llama-cpp-python[server]"
```

### Server won't start - port in use
**Solution:** Kill existing process
```bash
lsof -i :8080
kill -9 [PID]
./start_llm_server.sh
```

### Model file not found
**Solution:** Verify file location
```bash
ls -lh /workspace/models/
# Should show: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.gguf
```

## Key Differences from Previous Approach

### ❌ Old: Docker Hub Approach (Abandoned)
- Build Docker image with model baked-in
- Push 10GB image to Docker Hub (20-40 min upload)
- Pull image on Runpod (2-3 min download)
- **Issues:** Build failures, disk space problems, complexity

### ✅ New: USB Drive Approach (Current)
- Store model on portable USB drive
- Upload from USB to Runpod (5-10 min)
- Simple script starts server
- **Benefits:** Portable, simple, reliable, fast

---

**Status:** ✅ All setup complete. USB workflow ready. Begin Week 1 development!
