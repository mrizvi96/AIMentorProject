# Session Wrap-Up & Status - 10/30/2025 4:20 PM

This document summarizes the state of the project at the end of the session to ensure a smooth transition and prevent data loss.

## 1. System Status

**All services were successfully started and are fully operational.**

- **LLM Server:** Running on port 8080 with GPU acceleration confirmed.
- **Backend API:** Running on port 8000 and responding correctly after debugging.
- **Frontend Server:** Running on port 5173.
- **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX A5000 is active, with ~6.1GB VRAM in use.

## 2. Key Accomplishments

- **System Restart:** The main `runpod_restart.sh` script was executed, and several runtime issues were debugged and resolved live.
- **Dependency Fixes:**
    - A `numpy` version conflict was resolved by downgrading the package.
    - The backend was fixed by disabling the `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER` environment variable and explicitly setting the embedding model device to `cuda` in `rag_service.py`.
- **Evaluation Framework Created:** Based on the audit, the high-priority task of building the evaluation framework was started and substantially completed.
    - **Created Directory:** `backend/evaluation/`
    - **Created Files:**
        - `question_bank.json`: A comprehensive set of 20 questions for testing.
        - `METRICS.md`: Detailed criteria for scoring the RAG system's performance.
        - `run_evaluation.py`: The main script to execute the evaluation.
        - `README.md`: Documentation for the new evaluation module.

## 3. Last Known State & Next Steps

**The session ended while debugging the `run_evaluation.py` script.**

- **Problem:** The script was failing because it was trying to access `result["answer"]` from the RAG service output, but the service actually returns the results under the key `result["response"]`.
- **Last Action:** The AI was in the process of updating `run_evaluation.py` to use the correct key when the session limit was reached.

**Immediate next step for the next session:**
1.  Verify and complete the fix in `backend/evaluation/run_evaluation.py`.
2.  Re-run the evaluation script to get the baseline performance results.
3.  Analyze the results and begin prompt refinement.
