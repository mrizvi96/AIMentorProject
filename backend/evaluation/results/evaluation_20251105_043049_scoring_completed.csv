Q001,factual_recall,easy,What is Python?,"Python is a programming language. Its name comes from Monty Python, a comedy troupe. The context explains that Python was named after this group by its creator, Guido van Rossum (page_label: 41, file_path: course_materials/UDAYAN_DAS_Introduction_to_Python_Programming_-_WEB.pdf).",1,UDAYAN_DAS_Introduction_to_Python_Programming_-_WEB.pdf,0.478,3,5,5,4,5,N,Y,"It is correct, but the response should consider explaining ""What is Python"" to a introductory computer science learner, to that end, it could describe Python as a high level programming language as described in the source DR_JEAN_CLAUDE_FRANCHITTI_Introduction_To_Computer_Science_-_WEB which was not retrieved"
Q002,conceptual_understanding,medium,Explain the concept of recursion in programming.,"Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself. It's like when you're trying to solve a problem and the solution involves solving smaller instances of the same problem. For example, if you want to find the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, instead of writing out all the sums manually (which could be time-consuming), you can write a function that adds 'n' to the sum of all numbers from 1 to n-1. This is called recursion because the same function (sum) is being called again and again with different inputs until it reaches the base case, which is when we reach the sum of numbers from 1 to 1.
This technique is supported in many programming languages like C, where a function can call itself directly or indirectly through other functions. The context mentions that recursion is closely related to the mathematical concept of induction and they both are fundamental concepts used in algorithms and data structures. (page_label: 25, file_path: course_materials/Al_Aho_and_Jeff_Ullman_foundationsofCS.pdf)
However, it's important to note that recursion requires careful handling of the base cases to ensure that the function eventually terminates and avoids an infinite loop. (If this concept is not clear or if you have any questions, please let me know!)",1,Al_Aho_and_Jeff_Ullman_foundationsofCS.pdf,0.578,5,3,3,5,5,Y,Y,"A very basic programming example in pseudocode or python would be nice here. Also, ""...until it reaches the base case, which is when we reach the sum of numbers from 1 to 1.” is incorrect because the sum of numbers from 1 to 1 is just 1.
Not all recursion involves a function literally calling itself, the source is clear about indirect recursion also existing.
We also need to consider the output being able to use multiple sources and clearly being able to identify which one supports a particular statement

Q003,factual_recall,easy,What is a variable in programming?,"A variable in programming is a named location in the computer's memory used to store data that can change during program execution. It's like having a labeled box where you can put different things at different times. The context above emphasizes this idea by contrasting it with mathematical variables, which always have the same value within an invocation (Krishnamurthi, 2014, p. 57). However, it also distinguishes between identifiers and variables: while identifiers correspond to the mathematical concept of a variable, programming variables are the actual memory locations that can change. In other words, a variable is an identifier bound to a box whose content can be altered during program execution.",1,Shriram_Krishnamurthi_ProgrammingLanguages.pdf,0.578,4,3,3,4,5,Y,Y,"It is correct. variables are different from boxes per the source document. Page 41 of the same document describes what a box is, then page 57 clearly references this ""distinction"" and the authors say they will use different constructs for
boxes and for variables.

Q004,conceptual_understanding,medium,What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?,"Based on the context, a list and a tuple are similar in that they can both hold ordered collections of elements. However, they have key differences when it comes to mutability. A list is a mutable object, which means you can modify its contents after creation. For example, you could add or remove items from a list. On the other hand, a tuple is an immutable object. Once created, its contents cannot be changed. This is demonstrated in lines a and b of the context where tuples with different elements are assigned. The context also mentions that tuples allow duplicates like lists but are immutable, while lists are mutable.",1,UDAYAN_DAS_Introduction_to_Python_Programming_-_WEB.pdf,0.497,4,3,4,5,0,Y,Y,"Relevance: starts by talking about how they are similar when the question was about the difference. Faithfulness: A score of 0 was assigned because it alleges use of ""the context"", but this is never referenced in the output. ""lines a and b of the context"" are never presented but mentioned. Regarding clarity, it says ""tuples with different elements are assigned"", but it also says tuples are immutable. "
Q005,code_analysis,medium,What does the following Python code do: for i in range(5): print(i),"The provided Python code initializes a for loop that iterates 5 times. On each iteration, the value of ""i"" is printed to the console. This is a common way to print out numbers from 0 up to a specified number (in this case, 5), which is often referred to as counting or indexing through a range of numbers. It's like going through a list of numbers from start to end one by one, and in this context, no list is involved. The code itself can be found on page_label: 243 and the explanation starts around line 9.4 (line numbers might vary depending on the PDF viewer).",1,UDAYAN_DAS_Introduction_to_Python_Programming_-_WEB.pdf,0.471,5,4,4,5,5,Y,Y,"The code example in the source is found in ""EXAMPLE 9.4"", not in line 9.4, as it is not possible to have a line 9.4, a line in code can only be an integer. For clarity, say page 243 instead of page_label: 243"
Q006,conceptual_understanding,hard,Explain how binary search works and why it's more efficient than linear search.,"Binary search is an efficient method for finding a specific element in a sorted array or binary tree. In the context above, we're discussing its use in a binary search tree. The process begins by comparing the value to be found (x) with the middle element of the search space (p). If they match, we've found what we were looking for and our search ends. If not, we repeat the process on the left or right subtree based on whether x is less than or greater than p. This way, we're cutting the search space in half at each step until we find the target value.",1,opendatastructures.org_Open_Data_Structures_(Python_Edition).pdf,0.406,3,3,5,5,0,Y,Y,"The output explains binary search, but does not explain why it is more efficient than linear search, or tell us there is insufficient context to answer why it is more efficient than linear search. No citation of the source material is present."
Q007,factual_recall,easy,What is an algorithm?,"An algorithm is a precise and unambiguous sequence of steps to solve a problem. It can be expressed formally using a programming language, or in an informal way with English statements. The context mentions that different programming languages may have diﬀerent ways of representing data, but regardless of the language used, algorithms provide a clear set of instructions to accomplish a task. Think of an algorithm as a recipe for baking a cake - it lists out each step in order, allowing anyone who follows it exactly to produce the same result. (Sec. 1.1, page_label: 5)",1,Al_Aho_and_Jeff_Ullman_foundationsofCS.pdf,0.56,5,5,5,5,5,N,Y,
Q008,conceptual_understanding,medium,What is object-oriented programming?,"Object-oriented programming, or OOP for short, is a type of computer programming where the design centers around objects. An object contains both the data and the functions needed to process that data. Think of it like a capsule: the data is the contents inside, and the functions are the instructions on how to manipulate that data. The context from the course materials explains this concept by Forouzan and Gilber, as well as Gaddis, Walters, and Muganda.",1,Kenneth_Leroy_Busbee_programming-fundamentals-a-modular-structured-approach.pdf,0.665,5,4,4,5,0,N,Y,"""The context from the course materials explains this concept by Forouzan and Gilber, as well as Gaddis, Walters, and Muganda."" the output could better demonstrate that these are authors of one source ""Tony Gaddis, Judy Walters and Godfrey Muganda, Starting Out with C++

Q009,problem_solving,medium,How would you find the largest number in a list of integers?,"To find the largest number in a list of integers, you can use a simple algorithm called ""find minimum."" This algorithm starts by assuming that the first integer is the smallest number. Then it checks each subsequent integer and updates the assumed smallest number if a larger number is found. In this case, since we want to find the largest number instead, we just need to call this algorithm with the negation of each number to find the minimum, and then take the negative of that result. This way, the final answer will be the maximum number in the list.",1,University of Illinois_Algorithms_by_Jeff_Erickson.pdf,0.375,2,2,3,5,0,Y,Y,"This is incorrect. To find the largest number, it would make more sense to call it a ""find maximum"" algorithm, there is no ""find minimum"" algorithm in the source material, no page number or reference to the source is made, and the logic to find the maximum is incorrect."
Q010,factual_recall,easy,What is a function in programming?,"A function is a named sequence of statements that performs a specific task. Think of it as a recipe for your computer to follow. In the context above, Linus Torvalds' early project involved switching between printing ""AAAA"" and ""BBBB,"" which later evolved into Linux (page_label: 25). Functions may or may not take inputs (called parameters) and can produce an output or a result. The first line of a function definition is called the header, where we define its name, any parameters, and the type of data it returns. For example, in Python, you would write 'def my_function(parameter):' to create a new function named 'my_function' with one parameter.",1,Allen_Downey_thinkpython2.pdf,0.521,5,5,5,5,5,N,Y,
Q011,comparative_analysis,hard,Compare and contrast arrays and linked lists. When would you use each?,"Linked lists and arrays are two common ways to implement the List interface in Computer Science. Arrays use a contiguous block of memory with fixed size, while linked lists consist of nodes that contain list items and are connected via references (pointers).",1,Open Textbook Library_Open_Data_Structures.pdf,0.388,3,5,5,2,0,N,Y,"Relevance: The response does not answer ""When would you use each?"". No citations are present. Response is too brief as it does not cover tradeoffs in performance. For example, if the source material contains performance of arrays and also the complexity of adding/removing nodes in a linked list, then this information can also be included. If not, then tell us there is limited context."
Q012,conceptual_understanding,medium,What is Big O notation and why is it important?,"Big O notation is a mathematical tool used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It measures how the running time or space requirements grow as the input size increases. The context mentions that Big O notation was first used by Paul Bachmann in number theory and has since become essential in computer science for analyzing algorithms. It's important because understanding the efficiency of an algorithm can help us make informed decisions about which one to use, especially when dealing with large datasets or resource-constrained environments. In our specific context, we are given a piece of code (page_label: 13), but it doesn't contain enough information for determining its Big O notation.",1,opendatastructures.org_Open_Data_Structures_(C++_Edition).pdf,0.568,4,3,5,5,5,N,Y,"The code snippet on page 13 of the source does mention the Big O complexity, it says ""Using big-Oh notation, the running time simplifies down to T(n) = O(n)""

Q013,code_analysis,easy,What is the purpose of comments in code?,"Comments are used to explain what a specific part of the code does, making it easier for others (or even yourself in the future) to understand. They don't affect how the code runs, but rather serve as documentation. In the context provided, comments are mentioned as being used in both C# and JavaScript programming languages.

Q014,conceptual_understanding,hard,"Explain how memory management works in Python, including garbage collection.","In Python, memory management is mostly handled automatically by the interpreter through a process called garbage collection. When you create a variable in Python, the interpreter allocates memory for it on the heap, which is a large block of memory used for dynamic allocation. If that variable goes out of scope or is no longer referenced, the memory it occupies becomes ""garbage."" However, Python's garbage collector automatically frees up this memory to be reused by the system.",1,Shriram_Krishnamurthi_ProgrammingLanguages.pdf,0.501,5,5,5,5,0,N,Y,"There is no citation, and that could have benefited this output because the author has a personal preference for only using the term ""garbage collection"" when using automated techniques and so doesn't use the phrase ""reference counting"""
Q015,problem_solving,medium,How would you reverse a string in Python?,"Although the context provided does not explicitly mention reversing strings in Python, we can infer that there are functions called `reverse()` and `copy()` which can be used to manipulate lists. However, when it comes to reversing a string in Python, you don't actually need to use those functions as Python provides an easy way to reverse a string using slices. Here is an example:
```python
my_string = ""Hello, World!""
reversed_string = my_string[::-1]
print(reversed_string)  # Outputs: !dlroW olleH
```
In the above code snippet, the `[::-1]` slice is used to reverse the string. It starts at the end of the string and moves backwards one character at a time, effectively reversing the order.",1,UDAYAN_DAS_Introduction_to_Python_Programming_-_WEB.pdf,0.453,5,5,5,5,4,N,Y,A specific in text reference to where you can read about slices should be listed
Q016,factual_recall,easy,What is a data structure?,"A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer. The context explains that they are essential to computer science and are used in various applications such as file systems and phone contact lists. Data structures help us efficiently locate specific pieces of information, like finding the right block on a disk for a file or quickly looking up a phone number in a contact list.",1,Pat_Morin_120226_99Z_Morin_2013-Open_Data_Structures.pdf,0.55,5,5,5,5,4,N,Y,"the output correctly says ""the context"" mentions it, but the page numbers are missing"
Q017,conceptual_understanding,medium,What is the difference between a stack and a queue?,A stack and a queue are two different data structures used to manage collections of elements. The main difference between them lies in the order of accessing or removing elements.,1,Stephen_Wong_Principles_of_ObjectOriented_Programming_8163_r.pdf,0.535,3,5,3,3,0,N,Y,"The output is too short. It says the difference lies in the order of accessing or removing elements, what exactly is this difference in order? No citation to a page number or reference to a source has been made. The source material clearly states that a queue uses FIFO but a stack uses LIFO, this could have been part of the answer with the reference. The output is too concise."
Q018,comparative_analysis,hard,Compare interpreted languages like Python with compiled languages like C++.,"Interpreted languages, such as Python, JavaScript, and PHP, are executed line by line by an interpreter. This means they're not tied to a specific platform, making them versatile. However, the downside is that each line needs to be translated and run, which can lead to slower execution speeds compared to compiled languages (like C++).
Compiled languages, on the other hand, are first translated into machine code by a compiler before being executed. This results in faster execution times since the machine code can be directly processed by the computer without the need for translation during runtime. However, the disadvantage of compiled languages is that they're platform-dependent, meaning you need to recompile your code for each new platform.",1,DR_JEAN_CLAUDE_FRANCHITTI_Introduction_To_Computer_Science_-_WEB.pdf,0.442,5,5,5,5,0,N,Y,No attribution or in text reference 
Q019,conceptual_understanding,medium,What is a loop and why are loops useful in programming?,"A loop is a programming construct that allows the computer to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. In other words, it's like telling the computer to do something over and over again until certain conditions are met. This can be very useful for performing repetitive tasks or processing large amounts of data efficiently.",1,Stephen_Wong_Principles_of_ObjectOriented_Programming_8163_r.pdf,0.653,5,5,5,5,0,N,Y,No attribution or in text reference is made. There are also multiple sources which could have supported this.
Q020,problem_solving,hard,Design an algorithm to check if a string is a palindrome.,"To check if a string is a palindrome, you can use the following simple algorithm:
1. Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning of the string and another at the end.
2. Compare the characters at the positions indicated by the pointers. If they are not equal, return false as the string is not a palindrome.
3. Increment the pointer at the beginning of the string and decrement the pointer at the end until they meet in the middle or one goes beyond the limits of the string. If all comparisons are equal, then the string is a palindrome.
4. This algorithm works because a palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. By comparing corresponding characters from both ends and moving towards the center, you can confirm if this property holds for the given input.",1,University of Illinois_Algorithms_by_Jeff_Erickson.pdf,0.604,5,0,5,5,0,Y,Y,"The algorithm is not from the university of illinois source, however, users should get some pedagogical support instead of just getting the algorithm outright.
